# Router Setup Instructions

## Install Vue Router

To complete the router setup, you need to install Vue Router. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install vue-router@4
```

## What I've Created

I've set up a complete routing system for your Money Saver application with the following pages:

### 📄 **Pages Created:**

1. **Home (`/`)** - Landing page with hero section and register modal
2. **Dashboard (`/dashboard`)** - Overview of financial health with stats and recent activity
3. **Expenses (`/expenses`)** - Track and manage spending with filtering options
4. **Budget (`/budget`)** - Set and monitor budget categories with progress bars
5. **Settings (`/settings`)** - Account settings, preferences, and data export
6. **404 Page** - Custom not found page for invalid routes

### 🧭 **Navigation Features:**
