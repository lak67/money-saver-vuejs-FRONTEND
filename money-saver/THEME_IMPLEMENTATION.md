# ðŸŒ™âœ¨ Dark/Light Mode Implementation

Your Vue.js Money Saver app now has a complete dark/light mode theme system using shadcn/ui!

## ðŸŽ¨ **What's Been Added**

### 1. **Theme Management System**
- **`useTheme()` Composable**: Located in `src/composables/useTheme.ts`
  - Manages theme state (light, dark, system)
  - Persists preference to localStorage
  - Listens to system theme changes
  - Provides toggle and set functions

### 2. **Theme Toggle Components**
- **`ThemeToggle`**: Simple toggle button with sun/moon icons
- **`ThemeSelector`**: Full theme selector with all three options (Light, Dark, System)
- Both located in `src/components/ui/theme-toggle/`

### 3. **Updated Styling**
- **Navigation**: Now uses shadcn/ui color tokens and includes theme toggle
- **All Views**: Updated to use theme-aware colors
- **Settings Page**: Includes theme selector in appearance section

## ðŸš€ **Features**

### **Theme Toggle Button** 
- Shows sun icon in light mode, moon icon in dark mode
- Small blue dot indicates when system theme is active
- Located in the navigation bar
- Click to cycle through: Light â†’ Dark â†’ Light

### **Theme Selector** (in Settings)
- Three buttons: Light, Dark, System
- Shows current selection
- Full control over theme preference

### **Smart Theme Detection**
- Automatically detects system preference on first visit
- Respects user's OS dark/light mode setting
- Remembers user's choice in localStorage
- Updates automatically when system theme changes (if set to "System")

## ðŸŽ¯ **How to Use**

### **Quick Toggle**
Click the sun/moon icon in the navigation bar to toggle between light and dark modes.

### **Full Control**
Go to Settings â†’ Appearance section to choose between:
- **Light**: Always light theme
- **Dark**: Always dark theme  
- **System**: Follows your operating system setting

## ðŸ”§ **Technical Details**

### **Theme Variables**
Your CSS already had all the shadcn/ui theme variables set up:
- Light mode: `--background`, `--foreground`, `--card`, etc.
- Dark mode: `.dark` class overrides with dark variants
- All components now use these semantic color tokens

### **Implementation**
- Theme state is managed in a Vue composable
- CSS classes are toggled on the document root
- All styling uses CSS custom properties for automatic theme switching
- System preference detection uses `prefers-color-scheme` media query

## ðŸŽ‰ **Ready to Use!**

Your app now supports:
- âœ… Light mode with clean, bright interface
- âœ… Dark mode with elegant dark colors  
- âœ… System mode that follows OS preference
- âœ… Persistent theme selection
- âœ… Smooth transitions between themes
- âœ… Theme toggle in navigation
- âœ… Theme settings in Settings page

The dark/light mode system is fully functional and integrated with your existing shadcn/ui setup!
